# Wumpus World
See report.pdf for an in-depth description of my thought process and results.

Enter the world of the Wumpus, if you dare! This program solves wumpus world levels of various sizes. You probably don't want to run this yourself: it took me hours to get the java-prolog interface library working. Just read through the report instead.

## Usage
